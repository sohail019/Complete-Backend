<!-- HTTP -->

### Protocols and Ports

**Protocols:**
Protocols are sets of rules that define how data is transmitted over a network. They ensure that devices can communicate effectively and understand each other.

**Ports:**
Ports are virtual endpoints for communication. They help direct network traffic to the appropriate application or service on a device. Each protocol typically uses a specific port number to facilitate communication.

### HTTP and HTTPS

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):**  
HTTP is a protocol used for transferring data over the web. It is stateless and operates over port 80 by default. However, it does not provide encryption, making data vulnerable to interception.

**HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):**  
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data, ensuring secure communication between the client and server. HTTPS operates over port 443 by default and is essential for protecting sensitive information like passwords and credit card details.
